# Changelog

All notable changes to OmniDesk will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Homebrew/Chocolatey packaging for easier installation
- Development dependency security updates (electron v40+, vite v7+)

---

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **Linux build failure** — electron-builder derived `.deb` output path from scoped npm name, creating non-existent `release/@carloluisito/` directory. Added `artifactName` template and `linux.executableName` to fix artifact paths and desktop integration naming.

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **npm package name** — switched to scoped `@carloluisito/omnidesk` (unscoped `omnidesk` was taken)
- **npm repo link** — added `repository` field to `package.json` for GitHub sidebar linking

### Changed
- **Release artifacts** — renamed from `claudedesk-*` to `omnidesk-*`

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-27

Version reset to 1.0.0 — marks the official start of OmniDesk as an independent product. The GitHub repository has been renamed from `carloluisito/claudedesk` to `carloluisito/omnidesk`. This release consolidates all changes from v5.0.0 and v5.0.1 under the new versioning.

### Added
- **Multi-provider abstraction** — Pluggable provider layer decoupling CLI specifics from session management
  - `IProvider` interface (`src/main/providers/provider.ts`) defining command building, env vars, model detection
  - `ProviderRegistry` with auto-registration of built-in providers
  - `ClaudeProvider` (default) and `CodexProvider` (OpenAI Codex CLI)
  - Provider selector dropdown in NewSessionDialog (shown when >1 provider available)
  - `[CX]` tab badge for Codex sessions
  - `useProvider` hook with conditional UI (hides Claude-only features for non-Claude providers)
  - 3 IPC methods (`provider:*`): list, available, capabilities
  - `src/shared/types/provider-types.ts`: `ProviderId`, `ProviderCapabilities`, `ProviderInfo`
- **OmniDesk rebrand** — Renamed ClaudeDesk → OmniDesk across all branding, config, UI
  - Config directory migrated from `~/.claudedesk/` to `~/.omnidesk/` with automatic migration
  - Centralized `config-dir.ts` with `CONFIG_DIR`, `ensureConfigDir()`, `migrateFromLegacy()`
  - `managedByClaudeDesk` → `managedByOmniDesk` (backward compat read on existing worktrees)
- **Real-time session sharing** — Share live terminal sessions with remote teammates via LaunchTunnel relay
  - `SharingManager` managing host and observer WebSocket lifecycles (`wss://relay.launchtunnel.dev/share/<id>`)
  - Binary frame protocol with 12 frame types (`0x10`–`0x1B`): TerminalData, TerminalInput, Metadata, ScrollbackBuffer, ControlRequest/Grant/Revoke, ObserverAnnounce/List, ShareClose, Ping/Pong
  - Share via tab right-click context menu; generates share code + URL
  - Observers join read-only with scrollback buffer (5000 lines, gzip-compressed)
  - Control request/grant/revoke flow for observer input
  - Metadata broadcast (2s interval), keepalive ping/pong, automatic reconnect
  - Deep link support: `omnidesk://join/<code>` via `app.on('second-instance')` (Windows) and `app.on('open-url')` (macOS)
  - Sharing gated behind LaunchTunnel Pro subscription
  - Observer Ctrl+C (`\x03`) stripped from TerminalInput frames (same safety rule as local sessions)
  - `ShareSessionDialog`, `JoinSessionDialog`, `ObserverToolbar`, `ObserverMetadataSidebar`
  - `ShareManagementPanel`, `ShareIndicator`, `ControlRequestDialog`
  - `useSessionSharing` hook
  - `src/shared/types/sharing-types.ts` with full type definitions
  - 22 IPC methods (`sharing:*`)
- **UI redesign** — Tokyo Night design token system and new component library
  - `ActivityBar` (left sidebar navigation), `StatusBar` (bottom status strip), `SidePanel` (collapsible side panels)
  - New component library: `Button`, `Toast`, `ToastContainer`, `Tooltip`, `ProgressBar`, `StatusDot`, `BrandMark`, `ProviderBadge`
  - `tokens.css` (design token definitions), `animations.css` (shared animation keyframes)
- **`cleanupStaleShares()`** — New method that lists server-side share rooms (`GET /v1/shares`) and deletes any not tracked locally (orphan recovery from crashes or unclean shutdowns)

### Fixed
- **Orphaned share rooms** — `cleanupHostShare()` now sends a fire-and-forget `DELETE /v1/shares/{id}` to the server on all cleanup paths (app shutdown, unexpected WebSocket close, keepalive pong timeout), preventing orphaned share rooms that exhausted the concurrent room limit
- **TIER_LIMIT_EXCEEDED recovery** — `startShare()` now catches `TIER_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` errors, attempts to clean up stale server-side share rooms via `cleanupStaleShares()`, and retries the create if orphans were found
- **Test mock format** — Fixed all 16 sharing-manager test fetch mocks to match the actual API response wrapper format (`{ share: { id, share_code, ... } }`)

### Changed
- **IPC contract** — Expanded from ~166 to ~191 methods (16 domains)
- **Project scale** — ~160 source files, ~51,000 LOC, 16 domains, 16 managers, 483 tests across 33 test files
- **Version reset** — Repository renamed from `claudedesk` to `omnidesk`; version reset from 5.0.1 to 1.0.0

---

## [4.6.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added
- **LaunchTunnel integration** — Expose local ports to the internet via LaunchTunnel (14th domain)
  - `TunnelManager` with hybrid REST API + CLI (`lt preview`) process management
  - API key management with validation, stored in `~/.claudedesk/tunnel-settings.json`

  - Account info section (email, plan badge, status)
  - Request log viewer with method/path/status/duration/size columns

  - CLI auto-detection via `where`/`which`, `shell: true` for cross-platform spawn
  - Ctrl+Shift+U keyboard shortcut, ToolsDropdown entry with active count badge
  - 17 IPC methods (`tunnel:*`): 13 invoke + 4 events

### Fixed
- **Tunnel spawn ENOENT** — Use `shell: true` in spawn for cross-platform `.cmd` shim compatibility
- **Tunnel status mapping** — API returns `"active"` not `"connected"`; added to `mapApiStatus`
- **Tunnel CLI subcommand** — Fixed `lt preview --port` (was missing `preview` subcommand)
- **Tunnel URL parsing** — Match `URL:` output format from LaunchTunnel CLI (not `your url is:`)
- **API snake_case mapping** — Map `created_at`, `status_code`, `duration_ms` etc. to camelCase
- **Account response unwrapping** — API returns `{"user": {...}}` wrapper; now unwrapped correctly

  - AtlasPanel UI with idle/scanning/preview states
  - 6 IPC methods (`atlas:*`)

### Fixed
- **Git generate button** — Action bar Generate now auto-opens CommitDialog with the generated message
- **CommitDialog generate button** — Directly sets title from return value instead of relying on fragile useEffect prop chain
- **Silent null guard in useGit** — `generateMessage()` now shows error toast when no project directory is available instead of silently returning
- **Stale generated message** — Generated commit message state is cleared after successful commit

### Changed
- **IPC contract** — Expanded from 102 to 149 methods (118 invoke + 8 send + 23 event)
- **Project scale** — 138 source files, ~45,800 LOC, 13 domains, 13 managers

---

  - Improved session spawning reliability and reduced complexity

---

## [4.1.1] - 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **IPC Abstraction Layer** - Refactored IPC architecture to define each method once and auto-derive everything else
  - New `ipc-contract.ts` — single source of truth for all IPC channels, args, and return types
  - New `ipc-registry.ts` — typed handler registration with automatic cleanup
  - New `ipc-emitter.ts` — type-safe main→renderer push events
  - Reduced `ipc-handlers.ts` from 602 to ~290 lines
  - Reduced `preload/index.ts` from 367 to ~55 lines (auto-generated bridge)
  - Adding a new IPC method now requires changes to 2 files instead of 5

---

## [4.1.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **Full 4-pane split view support** - Users can now split panes individually up to 4 total panes
  - Added horizontal split button (⬌) to each pane header - splits pane left/right
  - Added vertical split button (⬍) to each pane header - splits pane top/bottom
  - Split buttons only appear when paneCount < 4
  - Blue hover effect distinguishes split buttons from close button
  - Enables complex layouts: 2x2 grids, 3-pane L-shapes, etc.

### Fixed
- **Split view limitation** - Previously, the toggle split button only supported switching between 1 and 2 panes. While the backend supported 4 panes, there was no UI to access this. Now users can create 3-4 pane layouts by splitting individual panes.
